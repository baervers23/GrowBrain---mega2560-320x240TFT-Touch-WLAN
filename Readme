Whats GrowBrain?
GrowBrain is my little digital gardening assistant and management system. Based on Arduino. Codet at Java with many big range
Settings. This brain helps you for smoother gardening. Look at the daa logs on SD Card and display Excel graphics for finer
tuning adjustment. Yeah actually semi-automatic, but also later full-automatic grow system. User friendly, partly safe smart connect, big Touch Screen, many settings for your personalized controlled greenroom.
